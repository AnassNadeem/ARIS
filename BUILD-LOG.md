# ARIS — Build Log

A daily journal of what got built, what broke, and what I learned. One bullet per day, Mon–Sat. Sundays off (non-negotiable).

**Companion docs:** `[ARIS-FINAL-PLAN.md](./ARIS-FINAL-PLAN.md)` · `[ARIS-EXECUTION-PLAN.md](./ARIS-EXECUTION-PLAN.md)` · `[ARIS-PHASES-WEEKLY-PLAN.md](./ARIS-PHASES-WEEKLY-PLAN.md)`

**Started:** 2026-05-04 · **Ship target:** 2026-08-31 · **Cadence:** 6 hrs/day × 6 days/week

---

## How to read this log

- **One line per day.** What was actually done — not what was planned.
- **Friction logged.** Bugs, dead-ends, and "this took 3 hours longer than expected" entries are *more* valuable than smooth days. Hiring managers read this.
- **Commits referenced.** Each entry should be tied to a real commit hash or PR where possible.
- **No backfilling.** If a day was missed, the entry says so. The log is honest or it's worthless.
- **Weekly retro at the end of each week** — what shipped, what slipped, what changes for next week.

## Phase 0 — Pre-Day-1 setup (Week 0, Apr 29 – May 3)

### Week 0 — loadout

- **2026-04-29 (Wed):** Locked the plan. Read `ARIS-FINAL-PLAN.md` end-to-end, confirmed CS+AI direction (no more revisiting), reframed target role to "Software Engineer — Vehicle Performance / Strategy Tools." Drafted GitHub profile rewrite (NeuroSim out, ARIS framing in) — staged, not yet pushed. Reserved Rajamani *Vehicle Dynamics and Control* via Brunel library (Wk5 read).
- **2026-04-30 (Thu):** Python 3.11.9 installed via `uv 0.11.11` (kept system Python 3.14.4 untouched as fallback). NVIDIA Studio driver + CUDA 12.x toolkit verified — `nvidia-smi` shows RTX 5070 (8GB), `nvcc --version` confirms toolkit. Git for Windows + GitHub CLI authed.
- **2026-05-01 (Fri):** Docker Desktop installed, `docker run hello-world` clean. VS Code + Python/Pylance/Ruff/Jupyter/Docker/GitLens extensions installed. Free-tier accounts created or verified: GitHub, Streamlit Community Cloud (GitHub login), Neon.tech (Postgres connection string saved to password manager), Hugging Face.
- **2026-05-02 (Sat):** Ollama installed, `llama3.1:8b-instruct-q5_K_M` pulled (~5.5 GB). Local inference smoke test: *"Explain F1 tire degradation in one sentence"* — answered coherently in ~6s on RTX 5070, VRAM headroom confirmed. Decision logged: Llama 3.1 8B local is the default LLM throughout the build; Claude API stays out of budget until Phase 7 demo polish.
- **2026-05-03 (Sun, prep day):** Repo skeleton committed (`src/aris/`, `scripts/`, `notebooks/`, `tests/`, `data/`, `models/`, `results/`, `configs/`, `learning/`). Planning docs landed in `docs/planning/`. `BUILD-LOG.md` and `ARIS-EXECUTION-PLAN.md` templates dropped at repo root. Day 1 (May 4) schedule set; Rajamani not yet collected from library (queue).

**Weekly retro (Wk 0):**

- Shipped: full toolchain (Python 3.11.9, uv, Docker, NVIDIA stack, Ollama + Llama 3.1 8B, VS Code, Git, gh), all free-tier accounts, repo skeleton with planning docs.
- Slipped: GitHub profile rewrite staged but not pushed (deferred to Day 1). FastF1 cache pre-warm (per execution plan §E) not run — pushed to Wk 1.
- Changes for Wk 1: hit the ground running on Day 1 — first commit, send Brunel WhatsApp, push profile rewrite, install FastF1 + start cache pre-warm.

---

## Phase 1 — Python foundations + first FastF1 plot (Weeks 1–2, May 4 – May 17)

### Week 1 (May 4 – May 10) — Day 1 ignition (delayed start, recovered Fri)

- **2026-05-04 (Mon, Day 1):** *missed.* Real-life slippage. No commits, no WhatsApp sent, no Day 1 ignition. Logging honestly per the no-backfill rule.
- **2026-05-05 (Tue):** *missed.*
- **2026-05-06 (Wed):** *missed.*
- **2026-05-07 (Thu):** *missed.* Four-day cold start now baked in; Fri/Sat/Sun reframed as a 3-day catchup sprint to land on Wk 2 cadence.
- **2026-05-08 (Fri):** Catchup ignition. Verified `uv 0.11.11` + Python 3.11.9 toolchain; created `.python-version` pinning the repo to 3.11.9 so anyone (or future-me) cloning gets the right interpreter. Confirmed `.venv` already targets 3.11.9. Wrote `scripts/prewarm_cache.py` — idempotent FastF1 pre-warm over 8 sessions (2024 Bahrain/Saudi/Australia/Japan/Miami + 2023 Bahrain/Belgium/Abu Dhabi), with per-session try/except, timing, and progress logging. Started the pre-warm — Japan 2024 hung on a stalled HTTP request (Ctrl+C wouldn't fire because the block was inside a C extension); killed the terminal, rerun, cached races skipped in <1s each as designed. Drafted `docs/planning/TO-DO.md` (the 5-notebook cap for Phases 0–2, hygiene rules, mid-plan check) and `docs/learning/SKILLS-MASTERY.md` (13-part self-test rubric: Python OOP through F1 strategy through MATLAB/Simulink) — the standard is "rebuild ARIS on a blank machine with no AI."
- **2026-05-09 (Sat):** Catchup sprint Day 2. FastF1 prewarm completed cleanly on retry — Japan 2024 succeeded second attempt; cached races skipped <1s as designed. Discovered `.gitignore` was syntactically broken (wrapped in a PowerShell here-string with leading whitespace on every rule, so no patterns were matching) — rewrote it from scratch, added `fastf1_cache/` and `.claude/` ignores. Wrote and pushed `README.md` with the locked one-line pitch, six-layer L0–L6 architecture, status table, "what ARIS is NOT" section, and a roadmap mapping each phase to a release tag — recruiter-readable at the repo root. Over-pushed `docs/planning/` and `docs/learning/` initially (NeuroSim docs, deep-research AI feedback, internal trackers all went public for ~30 minutes); corrected by untracking `docs/` wholesale and adding it to `.gitignore` — local files preserved, public repo cleaned. Drafted `notebooks/00-numpy-basics.ipynb` covering arrays, slicing-as-view, boolean indexing, broadcasting, vectorised math, axis-aware aggregations, seeded random, and a closed-form OLS via `np.linalg.solve`. Filled out the project skeleton: `src/aris/{physics,models,eval}/__init__.py` subpackages, `configs/.gitkeep`, and a `pyproject.toml` stub (hatchling build, ruff/mypy/pytest config, optional dev extras). Six commits pushed to `origin/main` across the day.
- **2026-05-10 (Sun):** Catchup sprint Day 3 — broke the "Sunday off" rule once to close out Wk 1. Scaffolded `notebooks/01-fastf1-first-pull.ipynb` (cache-wiring cell + section headers, TODO stubs for the load/inspect/pick/plot cells) and pushed as its own commit so the diff history shows scaffold → fill. Filled the stubs: loaded Bahrain 2024 Race from the pre-warmed cache (no network, 1129 laps × 31 cols, 20 drivers), picked VER's fastest race lap (lap 39, 1:32.608 on softs, tyre life 7) via `pick_drivers('VER').pick_fastest()`, pulled car telemetry with `get_car_data().add_distance()` (349 samples over 5.41 km, max 301 km/h), and plotted speed-vs-distance with matplotlib — the first real ARIS plot. Wrote `notebooks/02-pandas-basics.ipynb` covering Series/DataFrame, `.loc` vs `.iloc`, boolean filtering, groupby (single + multi-key + multi-agg), SQL-style merge, NaN triage, datetime-indexed `resample`, and a closing fuel-corrected pace ranking pipeline — same teaching shape as the NumPy notebook. Installed `nbconvert`/`nbclient`/`ipykernel` via `uv pip` to run notebooks headless from CI/scripts; both notebooks executed top-to-bottom from a fresh kernel before outputs were cleared for commit. Three commits pushed (`1ab7c7e` scaffold, `41feee0` Bahrain fill, `1d8775d` pandas).

**Weekly retro (Wk 1):**

- Shipped: `.python-version` pinning Python 3.11.9; idempotent FastF1 prewarm script with 8 cached race sessions; functional `.gitignore`; public-facing `README.md` with pitch + architecture + roadmap; project skeleton (`src/aris/{physics,models,eval}/`, `pyproject.toml`, configs); NumPy-fluency notebook committed; BUILD-LOG backfilled honestly; locally-archived planning + skills-mastery docs (gitignored).
- Slipped: WhatsApp to Brunel Racing **still not sent** (was Day 1 task). Pandas refresh and FastF1 first-pull notebook (originally Sat/Sun work) pushed to Wk 2 Mon/Tue. Lost ~1 hr to the docs/ over-push reversal.
- Changes for Wk 2: send WhatsApp Mon morning before any code. Pandas tutorial + `01-fastf1-first-pull.ipynb` Mon–Tue. Then Wk 2 original plan (stint-analysis notebook, README screenshot) Wed–Sat. Sunday properly off.

### Week 2 (May 11 – May 17) — pandas + first FastF1 plot

- **2026-05-11 (Mon):** Wk 2 ignition. Block 1 sanity check: re-ran `02-pandas-basics.ipynb` on a fresh kernel — green, no env drift (`ecd916e`). Scaffolded `03-pandas-deep-dive.ipynb` with three James Powell translation cells (`dtypes`, `groupby + named-tuple agg`, `.dt.total_seconds()`) on real Bahrain 2024 R lap data — no synthetic frames anywhere in the notebook. Block 2 Q1/Q2/Q3 implemented end-to-end: per-driver median race pace (VER 95.41s / SAI 96.10s / PER 96.21s top three after filtering pit-in/pit-out/non-green laps); compound pace deltas via `groupby + median + unstack` pivot (only SOFT and HARD pivot columns appeared — confirms Bahrain stints were SOFT-HARD-SOFT for most front-runners); VER lap-time progression chart with per-stint compound colours, median-pace reference line, and pit-stop markers, saved to `docs/screenshots/wk2-ver-pace-progression.png`. Block 3 merge mechanics: `pd.merge_asof` lap → weather joined cleanly (1129 rows preserved); standard merge lap → results required renaming `Position` → `FinishPosition` because `laps` already carries its own running-position `Position` column (`Position_x`/`Position_y` collision otherwise — that bug ate 15 min, the kind of footgun that won't bite twice now); Pearson r(TrackTemp, LapTime) for VER green laps as the toy correlation. Block 4: drafted `learning/kaggle-pandas-speedrun.ipynb` scaffold — six lesson sections, TODOs for the actual exercises (`069aa61`). Side fix: `00-numpy-basics.ipynb` cell 20 had `fuel = 100 - 1.5*lap` exactly collinear with the intercept + lap columns, so `np.linalg.solve(X.T @ X, X.T @ y)` was raising `LinAlgError: Singular matrix` on every fresh run — added small per-lap consumption noise so the design matrix is full rank (`1d53fff`). Four commits pushed (`1d53fff`, `672ebab`, `ecd916e`, `069aa61`). Day 2 prep verified against the real frame: FastF1 exposes a `Stint` column natively (VER = SOFT 1–17 → HARD 18–37 → SOFT 38–57), so Day 2's job is to rebuild that from `Compound` transitions + `PitInTime`/`PitOutTime` and check against the built-in.
- **2026-05-12 (Tue):** Stint analysis day. Wrote `notebooks/04-stint-analysis.ipynb` end-to-end (`0e24344`). `detect_stints` segments laps via `df.groupby('Driver')['Compound'].transform(lambda s: s != s.shift(1)).cumsum()` — the boolean `shift(1)` gives NaN on the first row which `!=` everywhere treats as True, so StintId starts at 1 with no extra logic. Verified identical to FastF1's native `Stint` column on Bahrain 2024 R VER (SOFT 1–17, HARD 18–37, SOFT 38–57). `compute_stint_metrics` fits `LapTimeS ~ TyreLife` per stint with `np.polyfit(deg=1)` after dropping the first lap of each stint (out-lap) and pit-in laps; guards `len(fit) >= 3` and returns NaN for the lap-1-pit edge case. Two surprises: (1) HARD median DegSlope is *negative* in Bahrain (-0.10 s/lap) because fuel burn (≈1.5 kg/lap → ≈0.04 s/lap gain) exceeds hard tyre deg — sanity check is SOFT minus HARD positive, not SOFT positive on its own. (2) Plot titles rendered as `â€"` mojibake on first run — em-dashes in the notebook source were UTF-8 bytes that got mis-decoded as cp1252 (â + € + " sequence) during the initial Write; replaced the 3-char sequence with ASCII hyphens and re-executed. Block 4 charts saved to `assets/screenshots/wk2-bahrain-stints.png` (top-5 horizontal timeline, broadcast-style) and `assets/screenshots/wk2-deg-curves.png` (DegSlope box-plot per compound) — not `docs/screenshots/` per the plan because `docs/` is gitignored repo-wide since Wk 1 Sat. Block 5 validation: Saudi 2024 R runs clean with no `StintNumber==0` bugs and no `|DegSlope|>5` fit failures; only one NaN slope per race from a driver pitting on lap 1, which the `min_laps=3` guard handles silently. Day 2 deliverable code is the prototype for Thursday's `src/aris/physics/stint.py` — lift verbatim, add type hints + a `Stint` dataclass, pytest with the VER three-stint case as the golden truth.
- **2026-05-13 (Wed):** Baseline day — the floor Phase 3 must beat is now on the books. Block 1 was a *markdown-only* problem statement in `notebooks/05-sector-baseline.ipynb`, committed before any code (`f1f88d0`) — forces the inputs / not-inputs / metric / split to be written out instead of assumed. Block 2: `moving_average_baseline(laps_df, window=3)` predicts lap N's `LapTimeS` from a per-stint `.shift(1).rolling(window).mean()` after sorting on `[Driver, StintId, LapNumber]` and grouping on `[Driver, StintId]` — three guards (sort, groupby, shift-before-rolling) together kill the lap-N-into-its-own-prediction leak. Sanity check: `n_stints * window` = `45 * 3 = 135` expected NaN preds on Bahrain 2024 R; got exactly 135. Bahrain MAE = **0.369 s** on 908 laps (`c70abf2`). Block 3 lifted the scoring math out of the notebook into `src/aris/eval/scoring.py` — `mae`, `rmse`, `per_race_mae`, pure NumPy, all three raise `ValueError` on shape mismatch and on any NaN slipping through; the notebook now re-computes through the module and asserts the float-precision match (`18d1abe`). Added `pythonpath = ["src"]` to `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` so tests find `aris.*` without an editable install (Day 4 still does `pip install -e .`). Block 4: looped over the 8 cached races, concatenated `(y_true, y_pred, race_id)`, scored per-race and overall. Numbers: Bahrain 0.369, Saudi 1.117, Australia 1.756, Japan 0.618, Miami 2.511, '23 Bahrain 1.116, Belgium 0.744, Abu Dhabi 0.367 — overall **1.090 s** across 6391 laps (`8c2378e`). Australia + Miami pull the average up because both had red-flag / SC laps that we aren't yet filtering on `TrackStatus` (Day 5 picks that up). Had to whitelist `results/wk2-baseline-mae.csv` + `results/wk2-window-sweep.csv` in `.gitignore` — `results/*` was globally ignored and the plan explicitly says commit this CSV. Block 5: swept `window ∈ {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}`. MAEs were 1.129 / 1.088 / 1.090 / 1.134 / 1.150 — w=2 is the empirical minimum, w=3 within 0.002 s. Picked **w=2** (smaller window = fewer leading NaN per stint, identical predictive power) and wrote the floor line into the CSV: `# BASELINE: window=2, MAE=1.088 s, 8 races (6734 laps), leakage-free per-stint shift.` Plot saved to `assets/screenshots/wk2-baseline-window-sweep.png` (the plan's path `docs/screenshots/` is gitignored, same as Wk 2 Tue's deg-curves chart) (`e374f31`). Block 6: 15 pytest cases in `tests/test_scoring.py` covering identical/shifted/mixed residuals, list-accepting inputs, shape mismatch, NaN in either side, empty arrays, RMSE > MAE on a single-outlier vector, `per_race_mae` returning a dict, single-race edge case — all green in 0.22 s. Friction: `.venv` had no `pip` (uv-managed) so `python -m pip install pytest` died — `uv pip install pytest jupyter nbconvert ipykernel --python .venv/Scripts/python.exe` is the right shape. Ran `nbconvert --execute --inplace` on `05-sector-baseline.ipynb` so cell outputs (table, plot, MAE prints) are pinned in the committed file. The 1.088 s number is what Phase 3's residual models have to beat, on the same 8 races, with the same scoring function — anything else is a moved goalpost.
